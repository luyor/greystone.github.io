## 1. Declaration and Definition
  * As a **local variable**:
  ```objc 
  returnType (^blockName)(parameterTypes) = ^returnType(parameters) {...}
  ```
  * As a **method parameter**:
  ```objc
  +/- (void)someMethodThatTakesABlock:(returnType (^nullability)(parameterTypes))blockName;
  ```
  * As an **argument to a method call**:
  ```objc
  [someObject someMethodThatTakesABlock:^returnType(parameters) {...}];
  ```
  * As a **typedef**:
  ```objc
  typedef returnType (^TypeName)(parameterTypes);
  // TypeName blockName = ^returnType(parameters) {...};
  ```
  * As a **property**:
  ```objc
  @property (copy, nullability, ...) returnType (^blockName)(parameterTypes);
  ```

## 2. Some Tips
* Normally, a variable is captured when the block is defined. It will be captured as a `const` variable, unless described as `__block`. Meanwhile, the compiler will add a strong reference count to it by 1, which also introduces a retain cycle problem here.

* Itâ€™s best practice to use only one block argument to a method. If the method also needs other non-block arguments, the block should come last.

## 3. Avoid Strong Reference Cycles under ARC
```objc
__weak __typeof__(self) weakSelf = self;
self.block = ^{
    [weakSelf doSomething];
}
```
However, sometimes, when the **self** is released outside, the method insdie the block will send message to `nil` object. In order to retain the variable during the block, you can try to strongify it:
```objc
__weak __typeof__(self) weakSelf = self;
self.block = ^{
    __strong __typeof__(self) strongSelf = weakSelf;    // __typeof__ is invoked in compile time
    [strongSelf doSomething];
    [strongSelf doMoreThing];
}
```
This **strongSelf** will be released after the block is completed.

## 4. Blocks with Concurrent
### Work with Operation Queue
```objc
NSBlockOperation *operation = [NSBlockOperation blockOperationWithBlock: ^{
    // ...
}];
// ...
NSOperationQueue *mainQueue = [NSOperationQueue mainQueue];
[mainQueue addOperation:operation];  // schedule operation on main queue

NSOperationQueue *queue = [[NSOperationQueue alloc] init];
[queue adOperation:operation];       // scheduel operation on background queue
```

### Work with GCD (Grand Central Dispatch)
```objc
dispatch_queue_t queue = dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0); // specify a queue priority
// ...
dispatch_async(queue, ^{
    // ...
});
```

## 5. Block Storage without ARC
```objc
static int(^globalBlk)(int) = ^(int input){ return input; }; 
// globalBlk is stored in global

void func() {
    __block int i = 32;
    int j = 1;
    void (^blk1)(void) = ^{ NSLog(@"%d %d", i, j) };  
    // blk1 is stored in stack
    void (^blk2)(void) = [blk1 copy];
    // blk2 is stored in heap
    int (^gBlk)(int) = [globalBlk copy];
    // gBlk is still stored in global, copy method will return the original object
}
```
